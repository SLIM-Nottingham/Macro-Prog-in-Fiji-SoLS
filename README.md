# **Introduction to Macro Programming in Fiji**

**The next workshop is scheduled for .**

This is a  1-day course specifically for staff, postdocs or PhD students based in the **School of Life Sciences**.

This workshop is aimed at users already experienced in “manual” Fiji-based image analysis, who would like an introduction into the automation of tasks and analysis. Prior knowledge of Fiji is essential, no prior knowledge of programming is necessary or assumed. Attendance on the “Introduction to Image Analysis in Fiji” workshop would be a sufficient prerequisite. Some programming theory will be given where necessary, but the workshop will be focused on using Fiji macros and macro function extensions to solve actual problems. The course is focused towards the analysis of fluorescence data, but the principles are transferable to any type of imaging. Both theory and practical components will be included. See <https://fiji.sc> for more information about the software we use in this course. 

Places are limited to 15 people, with two trainers.

# The topics covered are outlined below;-         

* Why/When write code
* What is Fiji
* The ImageJ2 Macro Language
* Recording Macros
* Writing macro with loops and conditionals
* Macro Functions
* Where to go next...


# Charges

There is a charge of £25 to attend this 1-day course. 

# Registration

To register for this workshop please email Seema Bagia (seema.bagia@nottingham.ac.uk) with:

# Other information

The workshop takes place in The Medical School, QMC, computer room A36 (located in the Greenfield Medical Library - **you will need your library card for acess**).

The day runs from 09:30 until 16:30. There will be an hour long lunch break and shorter breaks during the morning and afternoon sessions. 

You’ll be provided with a printed handbook for you to take away, but I suggest you also bring a note paper and a pen. Note that we will be using the computers in the room so you do not need to bring a laptop.
